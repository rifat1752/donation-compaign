When a user clicks on a donation card on the Home page, they are redirected to the Donation Details page for that specific donation.
The Donation Details page dynamically displays the information related to the selected donation, including the picture, title, description, and the donation amount.
A "Donate" button is prominently displayed on this page, with its background color matching the text color of the card on the Home page, ensuring a consistent and visually appealing design.
When the user clicks the "Donate" button, a toast or sweet alert is shown to provide a meaningful success message, enhancing user experience and feedback.

- Donation Page with Pagination:

The Donation Page lists all the donations made, with each row containing two donation cards.
Each card displays essential information, including the picture, category, title, price, and a "View Details" button.
The background color of the card matches the background color of the cards on the Home page

This feature allows users to search for specific donations based on their categories.
Users can input a category into the search bar, and when they click the search button, the homepage will display only the donations that match the specified category.
